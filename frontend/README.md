# Data Scout UI
This is the UI for the Data Scout package, which allows users to visually create a Data Scout pipeline, which can be exported as either a JSON definition file, or Pandas code. It works only in conjunction with the [accompanying Django backend](TODO).

## Docker
TODO: Provide a Docker install script that runs both the back- and the frontend

Then run the following commands:

3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
